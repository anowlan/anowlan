## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ally!

I'm a neuroscientist broadly interested in neuroplasticity in brain circuits that are crucial for motivated behavior. I have a prior experience working in the fields of genetics and molecular biology, sensory physiology (primarily olfaction and audition) and social behavior, but I decided to switch gears after graduate school to study the neurobiology of substance use disorders. I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the McElligott Lab at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, where I am investigating noradrenergic signaling in a preclinical mouse model of rapid opioid dependence and withdrawal syndrome. I use a combination of imaging, behavioral and electrophysiological techniques in my research, but my area of expertise is fiber photometry. I am interested in becoming more proficient in python (and coding in general) and using data science tools to improve the rigor and reproducibility of my work. A subsequent goal is to bring what I have learned into the classroom, and develop novel strategies to introduce undergraduates to coding as a useful skill across a broad range of potential career paths.
